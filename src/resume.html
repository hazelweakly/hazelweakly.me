          <p>
            Eden Health is a healthtech startup focused on providing Concierge
            Health for every employee. As the first Security-focused Systems
            Reliability Engineer, I helped scope and prioritize security related
            initiatives that balanced current business needs while keeping
            future opportunities open. Additionally, as part of embracing the
            Staff engineering role of soft leadership, I dedicated time to
            working on developer experience from a holistic approach. Part of
            that work resulted in redesigning how Eden Health thinks of
            developer environments, getting buy-in across the engineering and
            product organizations, and shepherding adaption of the chosen
            solution. Another part of that work resulted in the creation of a
            design system code repo that worked across React, React Native, and
            allowed for seamless collaboration between design, product, and
            engineering teams.

        <dd>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Helped build out the developer environments using Nix shells to
              create reproducible and ephemeral environments that were fully
              consistent between developers and CI; virtually eliminating rework
              and toil caused by environment mismatches.
            </li>
            <li>
              Revamped documentation regarding on-boarding for developers and
              integrated a discoverable bootstrapping mechanism into projects to
              create cross-team consistency, reducing on-boarding time
              significantly and creating ample automation opportunities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prioritized and built out the infrastructure required to adopt a
              mesh VPN solution as part of implementing zero trust networking.
            </li>
            <li>
              Worked with the Director of Security to help mitigate critical
              vulnerabilities as they came up.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built a design system for front-end development to facilitate
              integration and cooperation between design and engineering.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented authoring, consuming, and publishing infrastructure
              for using private package registries, enabling consumption of
              internal libraries in a secure and ergonomic manner.
            </li>
            <li>
              Building upon the previous developer environments, I developed a
              build environment DSL in Nix to generate complex and reusable
              environments using a consistent and centralized framework. This
              centralized and codified domain knowledge, and allowed for rapid
              iteration across N repos.
            </li>
            <li>
              Assisted with multiple critical vendor procurements, carefully
              selecting vendors to meet business needs with an eye towards
              saving money and increasing developer efficiency. The vendor
              procurements are expected to be finalized in Q3 2022 and achieve
              breakeven cost savings by EOY 2022.
            </li>
            <li>
              Assisted with adaption of modern observability infrastructure in
              the front-end, including creating and developing a javascript
              helper library and full Open Telemetry demo, and delivering an
              internal talk on the subject.

          <p>
            Galois, Inc., is a formal verification consulting company that
            specializes in high assurance software and cryptography. As the
            first Ops employee, I helped shape the career ladder and scope of
            responsibilities for DevOps, taking care to match existing concerns
            with evolving needs when possible. Part of that work resulted in
            advising on a coherent plan to address the recent growing desire
            inside the Department of Defence for transitionable research. I also
            built out an internal platform and front-facing developer portal,
            enabling infrastructure and tooling knowledge to be shared and
            utilized effectively and paving the way for future growth in
            infrastructure competencies.

              Helped build out and design the career ladder for DevOps and
              worked with the engineering council to envision what Ops at Galois
              looks like.
            </li>
            <li>
              Architected and implemented an internal platform on top of
              Kubernetes, using GitOps and NixOS for a fully auditable,
              reproducible, and automatic system.
            </li>
            <li>
              Raised cultural awareness within the company for the importance of
              infrastructure and engineering work within research projects.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reduced CI/CD pipeline times from 2 days to 10 minutes and reduced
              complexity by consolidating from 4 CI systems to 1 CI system.
            </li>
            <li>
              Shortened FPGA development loop by days, and enabled automated
              testing of FPGA machines by designing and deploying a CI system,
              testsuite, and cross-project CI coordination.
            </li>
            <li>
              Created development environments, CI and CD pipelines, and
              optimized releases for projects across a wide range of
              environments, from secure enclaves, to FPGAs, to cloud
              deployments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reduced PR merge times from weeks/months to days by championing
              automation tooling to make collaboration across and within teams
              smoother.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enabled the shipping of modern development tooling into a highly
              isolated system by creating a fully self-bootstrapping environment
              suitable for non-privileged HPC-like systems.

        <dd>
          <p>
            503 Collective was a web design agency startup that focused on
            providing content personalization as a service. The website built
            also included a microservice backend to handle and eventually
            subsume a lot of the legacy infrastructure of the client. While
            there, I rapidly accelerated the implementation time for design
            changes and increased the Percent Complete and Accurate fulfillment
            of design tickets to nearly 100% by translating traditional print
            design into a dynamic and coherent language across desktop, mobile,
            and apps. On the infrastructure side, I sped up development
            lifecycles on the order of weeks by implementing infrastructure as
            code automation, reliable CI, and reproducible developer
            environments.

              code transpilation errors.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built a design system and provided training as design lead, saving

            <li>
              Built a backend capable of self healing ingestion of data from a

            WFG National Title Company is a title insurance agency; my time
            there was spent as a web developer as well as implementing
            infrastructure. I transitioned all of the company websites from a
            fragile server setup to a containerized setup, significantly
            reducing deployment risk. In addition, I rewrote websites or tools
            in modern technologies as needed, speeding them up and securing them
            in the process.
