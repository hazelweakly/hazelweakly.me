As I spend more time working in systems and around them, I've slowly built up this mental model of how I perceive systems, the interactions within them, and the changes that happen over time.
A lot of this comes from the realization that so much is deeply interconnected with each other, in ways we can't imagine, and it interacts in ways we can't ever fully anticipate or intuit.
I'd like to share this model with you--of how I see systems--in the hopes that it also resonates with you the way that it has with me.

Before we begin, I'd like to ask you to get cozy, and pull up a chair.
Take a deep breath, relax, and nestle yourself into a tranquil state of mind.

Ready?

    Disturbance across every dimension of reality.
    Imagine an infinite pool of infinite stillness.
    As rocks drop into the pool they disturb the reality of the air, the water, the sound of the vibrations, it ripples forever.
    Forever changing the water ever so slightly.
-->

Imagine, if you will, a tranquil and perfectly calm emptiness.
Within it an infinite plane of water, perfectly still; never before touched, nor ever disturbed.
There is no wind, nor noise, not anything ever at all.
The void is formless, yet its form is peace.
Silent.
Serene.
This is the system, without the system; the image of that which does not change.
Let us paint upon this canvas the symphony of systems.

Imagine a rock, a small skipping stone that one might skip on a babbling brook.
Picture, if you can, the rock falling through space and time and air, piercing the fabric of reality as it falls into the water.

Piercing it.  
Puncturing it.  
Perturbing it.

Consider the rock, as it were, as it was, and now is.
As this rock fell, the falling took time, it took space, it moved energy; it rippled through air and splashed into water.
Absorb within you the sound the rock made as it hit the water, let it wash over you like a childhood memory, let it be familiar yet alien;
it is in some ways the first sound of this space.
Yet the sound itself is considered not alone, or in isolation, but rather as an accompaniment of the ripples along the water.
As they drip, as they drop, as they push themselves out across the water.
Where they will ripple and disturb the water forever, for all time.
Ageless and permanent in remembering the transience of the fall; leaving marks in the system not unlike scars, much like memories.

Consider the system, as it were, as it was, and now is.
Feel within yourself all of the changes that have occurred, the implications thereof, and the changes yet to come.
How they will cascade throughout time for eternity, though it was only but an achingly simple thing, a stone upon the water.

Inhale.  
Exhale.  
Feel.

    As more rocks drop and fall, they can make rhythm, sound, vibrations.
    The rocks fall and collide with each other in the air, in the water, on the floor.
    Stacking up and building formations which themselves help shape the sounds, the movement, the possibilities, the disturbance.

Imagine a rock, a small skipping stone that one might skip on a babbling brook.
I echo, I echo, to you, to you.
Picture, if you can, the rock falling through space and time and air, piercing the fabric of reality as it falls into the water.
I echo, I echo, to you, to you.

Piercing it.  
Puncturing it.  
Perturbing it.

Consider the rock, as it were, as it was, and now is.
It is not the same, nor is the system the same.
As this rock falls, does it trace the path of the one that came before?
It cannot, for even if it were to try, that path has been trod, and another path will be made anew.
All change is permanent, yet transient; meaningless, yet meaningful; the only constant is that there is none.
How does the sound of change change as the sound of change changes?
As the rock travels through water, as the water ripples anew, as the new ripples take flight, as that which was meets that which is.
How does the feeling of change change as the feeling of change changes?

So still and calm is the system, yet so froth with change;
not only must the system feel the change of each stone, but it bears the beauty of their interactions, their connections, their reflections.
Through and throughout, within and without, stone in and stone out; they dance within the system like lovers, frolicking for eternity in the music they have wrought.

Music is but chaos that is pleasing to the ear.
Change is but our feeble attempt to render order to that which cannot conceive;
an attempt to wrestle into time that which never believed in it.
Chaos is but the acceptance of change for what it is, entropy for what it feels, life for what it lives.

Inhale.  
Exhale.  
Feel.

    How does one respect that which was there before?
    How do we see the eternities ahead of us, the infinities around us, the possibilities within us?
    How do we coordinate with people we don't see and whose interactions we can't predict the effects of?
    What about people of ill intention? Or good? How do we separate them from the rocks? Can we protect ourselves from rocks thrown to destroy the rhythm? Should we try? Do we drown it out?

    In a way it's worth trying, in a way it's not.
    The rocks care not, nor does the water, but the people do, and they're the ones building the melody.
