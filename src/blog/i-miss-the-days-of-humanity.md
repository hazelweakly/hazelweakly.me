I miss the _forums_.  
I miss the _forums_ so much it hurts.  
I miss when research was about _discovery_ and _learning_ and _sharing_.

I miss when _humanity_ felt like it had _hope_,  
when _human_ interaction was plentiful,  
when _genuine connection_ wasn't rarer than gold.

I miss the days before _our souls_ were `destroyed` for the sake of the `market`,  
before _our knowledge_ was `plundered`,  
before _our humanity_ `exploited`.

I miss when the song of _humanity_ was _sung_ in the streets.  
I miss it, even though I born after the war was lost.

Now _we_ whisper the truth and shout the `lies`,  
but this was not the fault of _AI_.  
_We_ whisper the truth and drown in the `noise`,  
but this was not the fault of _academia_.  
_We_ whisper the truth and bury it in `disguise`,  
but this was not the fault of the _internet_.  
_We_ whisper the truth and watch as it `dies`,  
but this was not the fault of _humanity_.

_We_ whisper the truth because _we_ no longer know it,  
and know of no _one_ or no place or no where to find it.  
_Our oracles_ were slaughtered; _our teachers_ starved

If some*one* is lost in the desert, and goes many days without food or water,  
when _they_ are rescued, _you_ must do something very important:  
Do not feed _them_, _they_ will die; do not water _them_, _they_ will drown.

_Their bodies_ are not ready yet,  
_they_ will burst under the weight of _life_,  
_they_ must be brought back slowly.

What will happen to _us_ when _we_ starve _ourselves_  
of our _humanity_  
for decades?

What `horrors` will _we_ encounter  
as _we_ burn _our souls_?

Worse: how, on earth, in the heavens,  
will _we_ heal?

How does one _flame_ in the darkness,  
in the howling wind,  
find another _flame_ to huddle with,  
to keep warm,  
to share the connection of _humanity_  
and the joy of _learning_?

How does _one_ go on as the world gets snuffed out?

How does _one_ heal the garden  
where the `salt` was `sowed`,  
where the `poison` was `poured`,  
where the `rocks` were `thrown`?

How does _one_ heal that which has scarred so heavily  
it may never grow life again?

When _we_ recover,  
as _we_ eventually will,  
what will be left of _us_?

The nightmare of _humanity_ lost started  
with _those_ who seek to find it.  
_Publish_ and `perish`,  
draw _blood_ from the `stone`,  
turn _lead_ to `gold`.

But then it grew.

It became the `price` to `pay` to participate in society:  
"`give` us your _humanity_, `give` us your _thoughts_",  
"let us `profit` from the words _you_ pen,  
from the `inscriptions` _you_ carved,  
from the `art` _you_ created".  
The price was free;  
the cost was everything.

But then it grew.

As _we_ built `machines` to move `dirt`,  
ever faster, ever farther, ever higher.  
As _we_ built `machines` to construct `buildings` ever greater.

So _we_ did with words, structure, and thoughts.  
_We_ built `parrots` to `speak` sounds of saying,  
`words` of no _meaning_,  
`thoughts` of no _thinking_.

As _we_ built `machines` to speak `words`,  
ever faster, ever farther, ever higher.  
_We_ build today `machines` to construct `noise` ever louder,  
that _we_ might `drown` out every ounce of _humanity_.

Today, _you_ can find _me_, _you_ can hear _my_ voice,  
but tomorrow?  
I cannot _promise_ to _you_
