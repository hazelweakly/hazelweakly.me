> When going on an observability journey, there tends to be a few concrete phases that every company goes through.
> Understanding how those unfold and take shape as you mature your observability practices can help you identify when you’ll run into certain types of challenges, and when you’ll start really wanting certain tools and practices to help address those challenges.
>
> That said, when you’re communicating about this to others, you might often find that it’s difficult to explain how you know where you are in the journey, or articulate the issues you’re running into.
> Often, people express difficulty getting a shared understanding around this, which is where mnemonics and mental models can come in handy.

This is the result of some of those conversations! Take a look!
