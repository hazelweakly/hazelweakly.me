Hey again! Welcome back to part two of me reflecting on the past few quarters and writing down my answers to John Cutler and Tom Kerwin's questions on how leaders navigate uncertainty and ambiguity.
If you're lost, part one is [here](/observations-of-leadership-part-one).
Without further ado, here we go!

## Blend Diverse Perspectives

> Can you tell me about a time you needed to make space for many diverse perspectives, including those that you found particularly challenging?
> How did that inform collective decisions and actions moving forward?

## Patience and Self-Repair

> Can you share an example of a time you chose not to intervene in a situation, allowing it to resolve on its own?
> What informed this decision, and how did it turn out?

## Anticipate Effects

## Curiosity and Light Touch

## Both/And

> Can you tell me about a time you faced something that looked like a simple trade-off on the surface—an either/or situation—but it turned out to be a both/and situation?
> How did you navigate the situation?

## Intervene Safely

> Can you tell me about a time when you and your team tried out a new way of working, interacting, or behaving?
> How did you decide what to try?
> How did you figure out whether to double down or change again?
