Part three, because the sequel always sucks, and this is my chance to redeem myself in the eyes of the franchise superfans.
If you're not familiar, this is a series of me reflecting on the past few quarters and writing down my answers to John Cutler and Tom Kerwin's questions on how leaders navigate uncertainty and ambiguity.
If you're still lost, part one is [here](/observations-of-leadership-part-one) and part two is [here](/observations-of-leadership-part-two).
