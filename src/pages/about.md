Currently, I spend my days building out teams of humans as well as the systems and tooling to make life better for others.
It's fun, challenging, and it can be a bit of an under-appreciated art.
It's not enough to solve the technical challenges, it's just as important--if not more so--to address the social ones.
Any sufficiently complex system is a sociotechnical one, and so any sufficiently effective solution must be holistic in its approach and not neglect the core idea that--at the end of the day--humans are the ones operating within these systems.

Today, what I strive to do is build things that bring delight and wholeness to others, that they might create ideas of beauty, and build expressions of their soul.
I want nothing more than to build a world in which people collaborate with each other, build beautiful creations, take delight in the creations of others, and strive see each other deeply.
Happiness, to me, is a world in which people can show up authentically as their whole self and help craft a sense of wholeness in their communities.

I am the resident infrastructure witch of the [Hachyderm](https://hachyderm.io) mastodon instance, and love talking about how we've handled some pretty tricky issues without burning out people or servers.
I also built the first set of official [GitHub actions](https://github.com/haskell-actions/setup) for the Haskell language and helped maintain that for a while, although I mostly sit on the backburner now as it's turned into a lovely project and ecosystem in my absence.
I aspire to leave myself open for meaningful consulting and advising opportunities, and invest time towards mentoring others.
I've given [talks](/media/#talks) in a few conferences about my experiences, appeared on quite a few [podcasts](/media/#podcasts), and I love sharing what I've learned with the world.
Lastly (but certainly not least), I currently serve as a Director on the board of the Haskell Foundation and as the first Fellow of the Nivenly Foundation.

I do strongly believe that intersectional advocacy is not only needed, but necessary.
To that end, I am continually working to be better at listening, understanding, and holding space for others.
I have a focus on underrepresented minorities in tech because that aligns closest with my personal life, but I strive to be an understanding and empathetic advocate in every aspect I can.

When I'm not working or programming, you can find me swing dancing, doing gymnastics, shooting pool, playing board games, playing with makeup, thrift shopping for the perfect dress, drinking coffee, sampling scotch, or playing with my dog, Lupita; I've been told I have too many hobbies, so, naturally, I like to add more over time.
Research interest wise, I tend to get most into resilience engineering, psychological safety, organizational design, empathetic leadership, systems safety, build systems, distributed systems, programming language theory, type systems, category theory, formal verification, and information geometry.
I also read quite a bit, and frequently write about my findings on [mastodon]({{socialMedia.mastodon.url}}), [bluesky]({{socialMedia.bluesky.url}}) and my blog.
