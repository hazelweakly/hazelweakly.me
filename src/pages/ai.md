title: Hazel on AI Usage

Nothing on this website, on my blog more generally, or any of my writings are written by an AI tool.
My talks are not AI, my posts on social media are not AI, my word are not AI.
If you see it by me on the internet, it was 100% non-GMO organically junk-food-fed written by yours truly.
I like being the voice behind my content, I like that everything I write is recognizable as "my voice", and I consider that to be one of the most valuable aspects of my writing process.

Now, it's _possible_ that I might eventually create a demo to show you what AI content does, or what it looks like, in which case it will be clearly marked with "I WROTE THIS WITH AI" or something to that effect.
Sometimes playing with things are fun, and I love teaching others, so it makes sense that I might eventually end up teaching people about AI.
But, as of now, I have no plans to do that.

I don't have a newsletter yet, but if I did, it also wouldn't be AI.
I mean, seriously, I don't even use tools to cross-post between platforms yet; all of my posts that appear both on bluesky and mastodon are literally manually copied over.
That... I'll probably get around to fixing eventually, mostly in the interest of saving time, but in an opt-in fashion, y'know?

Anyways, if I wrote it, it's coming straight from my brain, no filter, no generation.
You're welcome! I think?
