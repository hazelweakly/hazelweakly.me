# Carrying The Torch: Grief and Remembrance in Open Source

---

# Let's Start With Memory

<!--
How do we do it?
-->

---

# Memory for the Self

---
layout: intro
---

# Anchors, Artifacts, Connection

---

# Collective Memory

---
layout: intro
---

# Culture, Process, Connection

---
layout: quote
---

# Identity is the strongest anchor humans have, and is the grounding root through which we find meaning.

---

# Grief

<!--
Broken connections are processed with grief.
Grief is the mind's repair, like broken bones.

(Maybe joke: 5 stages of grief for downloading games via T1 connection)
-->

---

# Relationships

<!--
Before we dive too deep on breakage, we should probably talk first about formation
-->

---
layout: quote
---

# A person will build a tool in order to care for themselves. A community will build a process to care for each other.

---

# Historically: Software Development

<!--
You build it, publish in library, they find it, use, fix, share with you, etc.
-->

---
layout: intro
---

# Your Role: All of Them

---

# Implicit Process Must Now be Explicit

<!--
Parasocial. Capitalism. Broken structures. Intuitions don't translate anymore.
-->

# Relearning How to Grieve

# The Shape of Grief

- Collective
- Return to full function takes years
- Adaptation, not recovery
- Continuing Bonds with those who are lost
- Rituals of transition

<!--
- inter-subjective (shared across people)
- central to constructing meaning
-->

---

# Meaning is Collectively Built

<!--
Collective ownership is a skillset that we have started to collectively lose as a society
-->

---

# Let's End with Memory

<!--
Story of hachyderm. Losing Nova. Grief.
-->

---
layout: quote
---

# We are—collectively—shaped by the cultures we nourish; the mended threads that connect us; the memories we share.
