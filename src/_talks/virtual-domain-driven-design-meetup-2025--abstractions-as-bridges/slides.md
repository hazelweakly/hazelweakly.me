title: Abstractions as Bridges
info: |
  Have you ever wondered about what makes a good abstraction vs a bad one? Do you want to examine potential reasons why efforts to develop abstractions at a company or in a project take hold, and some don't? Or what it takes to develop an abstraction that reaches beyond the technical corner of your company or project and becomes something that helps actually shape how you think about the entire problem?

  Understanding the process of developing abstractions, especially as a leader, is really about understanding the process of grief. Even if you get to build the abstraction, it won't be the one you pictured, or envisioned. You're going to need to take the seeds you've born, carefully curated, and lovingly built up over time… And watch them die. To build an abstraction is to hold the heart of your humanity in your hands. Plant your soul into the ground, and be reborn.

  In this session, I'm going to introduce my thoughts on abstraction, how it works, why it sometimes works and why it sometimes doesn't, and how one can actually take an abstraction and flesh it out to the point where it takes on a life of its own. With that, you should be able to have a better grasp on how ideas can take root in a way that bridges people and domains together.

# Abstractions as Bridges

<!--
Story about working at DV

Abstractions were all wrong

Wanted to help, but how?
-->

---

# Building Bridges

<!--
Story:
Bridges are great, but have you ever seen them built?
How do they even do that?

The trick is in the support.
Tiny bridges make big bridges.

Compounding over time.

# The Littlest Bridge

<!--
Pre-requisites:

If you give a mouse a feature
they're gonna need the code first
...
(etc)
end w/rebuild the universe joke

## Even Little-er Than That

<!--
I wanted to build something but we were so overwhelmed that even the tiniest change felt too big

# Abstraction Is...

Something you use to help _shape_ and _articulate_ the **desired emergent behavior** of _systems_

---

# Interventions

<!--
From Dr. Cat Hicks, great insight.

Insight: Mindset + Context, Seed and Soil.

Remember that support? You can't build a bridge, no matter how tiny, without the support.

# (Mindset x Context), (Seed + Soil)

Interventions are the seeds.

Culture and politics are the soil.

"How we got here" is the context.

<!--
So we started with DevEx. We can't rebuild in a day, but we can start somewhere.

The best place to start is where it hurts and where the soil is fertile (pulse survey platform eng).

# The Second 80%

<!--
Estimating your impact in the next quarter is demoralizing.
How do y'all do it?

I take my roadmap, pick two items I don't care about, one I do, and then throw all three away.

# Leverage Points

1. The power to transcend paradigms.
2. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system — its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters — arises.
3. The goals of the system.
4. The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure.
5. The rules of the system (such as incentives, punishments, constraints).
6. The structure of information flows (who does and does not have access to information).
7. The gain around driving positive feedback loops.
8. The strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the impacts they are trying to correct against.
9. The lengths of delays, relative to the rate of system change.
10. The structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport networks, population age structures).
11. The sizes of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows.
12. Constants, parameters, numbers (such as subsidies, taxes, standards).

# Leverage Points without Authority

1. The gain around driving positive feedback loops.
2. The strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the impacts they are trying to correct against.
3. The structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport networks, population age structures).
4. Constants, parameters, numbers (such as subsidies, taxes, standards).

# Leverage Points _with_ Abstraction

1. The power to transcend paradigms.
2. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system — its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters — arises.
3. The goals of the system.
4. The rules of the system (such as incentives, punishments, constraints).
5. The structure of information flows (who does and does not have access to information)

# The Real Power of Abstraction

When done right, it changes the very fabric of how a collective perceives knowledge itself.
