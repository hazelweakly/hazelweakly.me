title: "Understanding Platforms: What They Are, Why They Work, When to Use Them, How to Build Them"
description: |
  Technical concepts are something that are thought of, approached, and understood differently across engineers, managers, and executives. Bridging the gaps and providing understanding to a complex and nuanced topic across all three groups can sometimes feel impossible. In this talk, we'll do just that.

  Together, we're going to go over not just platforms and platform engineering, but the very fabric of doing, what it means to learn, and how collective thought scales across a team, an organization and an industry. Utilizing that, we'll go over platform engineering from the perspectives of an engineer, a manager, and an executive. All at the same time.

  Not only will we go over a consistent framework for how each group can think about and understand platform engineering, we'll spend time going over how each group can communicate with other and understand each other in a way that's effective, actionable, and transformative.

## How Do We Do?

One of the main hurdles when building a company is figuring out how to scale decision making

<div class="fragmented">
Relationships change fundamentally based on their scope

<div class="center my">

| 1    | 3-5   | 15       | 50                          | 150                                    | ... |

| self | group | 3 groups | $3\times(3\ \text{groups})$ | $3 \times (3\times(3\ \text{groups}))$ | ... |

Every combination is a different relationship and collaborates differently.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
* The effectiveness of a collaboration model is influenced by the scope, the context, and the motivation under which it's utilized.
* Ideal collaboration happens when the ownership of the work, the motivation to do it, and the authority to complete it are all mutually aligned.
* There's another set of factors here: Time, and Stability.
  [(They're less relevant than you'd think)]{.text-2}
* We think of Time as teams having a life-cycle, but that's not really true in the traditional "Forming, Norming, Storming, Dying" sense.
* We like stability because it's an effective compensation mechanism for working around bad management, poor alignment, lack of agency, overload, and context switching.

<!-- header: What is a Platform? -->

## Platforms Are a Way to Scale Doing

## What is a Platform?

IC
: Platforms are the Dual of Libraries

Manager
: Platforms turn Service Teams into Product Teams

Exec
: Platforms derisk diversification by exploiting the economics of agglomeration

## Totes Platforms™

- Kubernetes
- Design Systems
- Programs
- Education Curriculum
- Corn
- Sales Funnel
- Jazz Standards
- Mission, Strategy, Vision, Objectives
- Executive Alignment
- Policy
- Language
- APIs
- ISO Standards
- Algebraic Structures Equivalent to Computational Models
  [regex is a platform. die mad about it.]{.text-2}

## Platforms Are Not

These are tools and a means to an end

- Platforms
- DevOps
- Kubernetes
- Libraries
- Process
- Culture
- Infrastructure
- Golden Paths
- SDKs
- Self-Service Platforms
- Cookbooks
- Enabling / Platform Teams

{.cols .leading-tight}

## Platforms ≠ Platform Engineering

<!-- platform engineer and platform engineering are unrelated much like SRE and resilience engineering -->

## Libraries vs Platforms

<div class="columns leading-tight">

<div>

### Libraries

- Representation of domain knowledge
- Abstracts over implementation
- Interfaced with via process
- Codifies semantics
- Multiplier for platforms

</div>
<div>

### Platforms

- Representation of knowledge application
- Abstracts over integration
- Interfaced with via policy
- Codifies workflow
- Enables library creation

</div>

</div>

## Platforms Turn Services into Products

This isn't always good.

It's not always what you want.

You will always need both services and products.

## Platform Synergy

IC
: Libraries are the building blocks of Platforms

Manager
: Platforms synergize with executive alignment _and_ team dynamics

Exec
: Platforms operationalize Libraries the way Programs operationalize Policy
{.text-3}

## DevOps vs</br>SRE vs</br>Platform Engineering

---

DevOps
: A culture of whole-system ownership motivated by broadening horizontal context

SRE
: A specialist role in resilience engineering that naturally arises when horizontal context becomes too large for any one team

Platform Engineering
: An empathy-driven approach towards sociotechnical organizational design

## Mapping Organizational Structures to Doing

<h3>

$$ \text{Motivation} + \text{Relationship} + \text{Context} = \text{Action} $$

</h3>

## Slicing Context - Functional

![](./images/functional-org.png){.mia .h-75}

## Slicing Context - Product

![](./images/product-org.png){.mia .h-75}

## Slicing Context - Matrix

## Directional Context

<div class="columns">
<div>

### Vertical

- Specialized Knowledge
- Effective action in the organization
- Cognitive overhead required for doing
- Utilizes consensus

</div>
<div>

### Horizontal

- Collective Knowledge
- Effective learning in the organization
- Cognitive overhead required for collaboration
- Utilizes alignment

</div>
</div>

## Context + Collaboration

|                | Vertical ctx size | Horizontal ctx size | Collaboration Complexity | Market Agility |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| **Functional** | high              | low                 | low                      | low            |
| **Product**    | moderate          | moderate            | moderate                 | moderate       |

## Cheating the Matrix

<div class="fragmented">

If you "aren't" a matrix organization, but...

- You have teams that rotate projects
- "Dynamic" or "rotating" teams are a thing
- You keep "shifting left" everything
- You compulsively CC 5+ people on every email

You may be entitled to financial compensation

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
* Building a stable base of knowledge is how you scale collective learning as a society

  But, how do you build a base of knowledge if scaling requires managing context?

## Shrinking Context

IC
: Well designed abstractions

Manager
: Thoughtful interfaces between teams

Exec
: Consistent language and mental models
{.fragmented}

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
* Well designed abstractions are both transparent and opaque
* Thoughtful interfaces between teams result in effective collaboration models
* Humans chunk concepts together to build on top of them

  Providing consistent language and mental models allows people to build their own chunks in a way that results in aligned growth of understanding

## Properties of Good Platforms

- Reduce horizontal context
- Enable emergent innovation
- Enable experimentation
- Minimize migration cost
- Minimize collaboration model overhead
- Improve feedback loops
- Minimize context switching
- Reduce IC context overhead

## My Sincere Apologies to Finance Teams and MBAs

## Economics ⇔ Technology {.text-5}

| Economics              | Technology              |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| _Scarcity Economy_     | _Post-Scarcity Economy_ |
| Fiat currency          | Social currency         |
| Market pressure        | Consensus               |
| Markets                | Tech Stacks, Codebases  |
| Fiscal Debt, Inflation | Tech Debt               |
| Economies              | SDLC, DevEx             |
| Context                | Cognitive Overhead      |

{.text-2}

## Economic Model - Functional

- Economics of scale
- Tech Vertical - often viewed as a cost center
- Value generation comes from removing waste from feedback loop

## Economic Model - Product

- Economics of scope
- Tech Vertical - often viewed as a profit center
- Value generation comes from reuse of overhead when diversifying

## Economic Model - Matrix

- Economics of density
- Often viewed as ~~too much paperwork~~ multiple centers
- Value generation comes from efficiencies generated by peer proximity

## Continuity, Economics

|                | Economy | Growth Strategy     | Continuity | Risk     | Market Agility |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------------- | ---------- | -------- | -------------- |
| **Functional** | Scale   | Market Development  | low        | low      | low            |
| **Product**    | Scope   | Product Development | high       | moderate | moderate       |
| **Matrix**     | Density | Diversification     | moderate   | high     | high           |

## When to Platform?

Platforms make sense when the benefits of reducing horizontal context more than offset the overhead of adding a vertical to the organization.

$$
\displaylines{\text{\# verticals in platform's scope} \\ \times \\
((\text{Emergent Innovation} + \text{Context Reduction}) - (\text{Collab Overhead} + \text{Migration Cost}))}
$$

## Platforms must be more than the sum of their parts

# Takeaways

<!-- _class: dark -->

<!-- header: Takeaways -->

## A Platform Is An Abstraction That Platforms Like A Platform

## Platform teams are organizationally empowered to address cross-cutting changes

With a combination of technical, procedural, and cultural improvements

## Platform Engineering can turn culture into an intuition around how to use a platform

## Make Change Easy to Handle, Not Easy To Do

## Failure Modes

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
* DevOps tends to fail because the sharp and blunt ends of a system are rarely aligned and addressing that requires a cultural shift
* SRE tends to fail when implemented prematurely; it only makes sense when the horizontal context is too large for any one team
* Platform Engineering tends to fail when implemented without empathy and diversity
* Platform Engineering tends to fail when an agglomeration based approach isn't used to address optimizations

## Platforms are a way to scale doing

## What is Platform Engineering

IC
: Empathy Driven Development

Manager
: Empathy Driven Collaboration

Exec
: Empathy Driven Organizational Design

## Platform Engineering is Empathy Driven Learning
