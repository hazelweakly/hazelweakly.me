# So You Want to Hire for Platform Engineering?

layout: two-cols-header

# What's the Talk About?

::left::

We're covering:

- The part of the hiring process engineering leaders have control over
- One way to view the differences between Platform Engineers, Infrastructure, SREs, etc.
- How to think about skills your organization needs
- Hazel's Opinions and Experiences (which have been very successful!)

::right::

This is **not**:

- A comprehensive guide to cover leveling, career progression, retention, business continuity, attrition risk, culture, ... etc
- A rant about (insert controversial topic)
- A guide to _all_ engineering hiring
- A copy-and-paste template
- Authoritative

# Quick Recap on Resilience Engineering

Resilience Engineering concepts can be grouped into four main ideas:

- **Rebound:** Ability to bounce back.
- **Robustness:** Ability of a system to tolerate disruptions.
- **Graceful Extensibility:** How does a system stretch to handle surprises.
- **Sustained Adaptability:** The ability to regulate and manage the adaptive capacity of your system.

# Platform Engineering Archetypes

If you squint, you can loosely map the aspects of resilience engineering into job archetypes:

- **Rebound:** SRE
- **Robustness:** Infrastructure
- **Graceful Extensibility:** Platform Engineering
- **Sustained Adaptibility:** Developer Experience

Bonus attributes to look for: Intellectual Humility and Ecological Awe

# The First Team

What do you really need?

<!--
Just like executives, platform engineering needs a first team.

Likely well rounded in the first team, looking to grow the members out into independent team leaders later
-->

# Example Time!

<!--
(Here's how Hazel set up her interview loop and what she looked for)

# The Process

Four stages:

1. Let's learn about each other
2. Let's solve a technical problem together
3. Let's solve a sociotechnical problem together
4. Let's see how you and your future stakeholders + cohort get along

The number of stages is a lot less important than the end-to-end time.

Aim for an average end-to-end time of under two weeks.

# Your Pipeline is Eliminating All the Talent

<v-switch>

<template #0>
Demographics in = Demographics out?

- Interviews aren't hazing rituals
- Track after-hire indicators
- _All_ current engineers should be able to pass without practice

</template>

<template #1>
Whiteboard coding is worse than useless

Testing software engineers with whiteboard coding is like testing an aerospace engineer by their ability to build a paper airplane
</template>

<template #2>
"Passion" = Puts up with abuse
</template>

<template #3>
"Side Projects" = I make my wife raise the kids

The question to ask is: "What are the _environmental conditions_ that allow this to appear?"
</template>

<template #4>
Moneyball for software engineering goes counter to how talent is perceived
</template>

<template #5>
Good research on assessing talent and hiring knowledge workers doesn't exist

Due to system incentives, it will also likely _never_ be funded
</template>

<template #6>
Systems thinking comes easier to discriminated demographics
</template>
