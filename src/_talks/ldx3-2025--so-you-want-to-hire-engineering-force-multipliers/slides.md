# So You Want to Hire Engineering Force Multipliers?

layout: two-cols-header

# What's the Talk About?

::left::

We're covering:

- What force multipliers actually look like
- Interviews in the age of AI
- How to improve and debug your interview process

::right::

This is **not**:

- A copy-and-paste template
- Authoritative
- A comprehensive guide to _everything_ on hiring

# Force Multipliers and Innovation

Cumulative culture. Intellectual humility. Ecological awe.

<!--
The core of intellectual humility is a meta-cognitive ability to recognize the limits of one's beliefs and knowledge.
-->

# Hiring in the<br/> AI Era

<!--
The best way to win is to not play the "are you cheating" game.

# Writing a Better Interview

1. Experiment a lot
2. Select for factors that are "impossible" to game
3. Identify signals that show **regardless of socioeconomic background**

# The Privilege Factor

Socioeconomic environments influence social cognition

Marginalized $\rightarrow$ via cultural processes

Privileged $\rightarrow$ via technical processes

Most interviews only test technical _solutions_ to "technical problems"

<!--
The important part for hiring is the author's observation that the conditions in lower class communities promote social cognition via cultural processes

Concretely: rather than looking for social cognition signals _only_ via technical process, I teach interviewers to identify fluency signals of cultural _and_ technical processes.

I also structure systems questions to bring out both skill-sets.

# Designing a Better Interview

layout: intro

# Exercise Time!

1. Write out your favorite "system design" interview question
2. Follow along with me and we'll improve it
3. Then we'll debug it and iterate

# System Design

> "How would you approach splitting a monolith?"
>
> (insert a description of the monolith here)

<!--
it primes the interviewer to look for a specific architecture and approach
towards "thinking out loud" and its overly biased towards "technical" cognition

# Identify What Good _Can_ Look Like

<Transform :scale="1.4">

1. What is the "cultural" approach to this?
2. What's the "technical" approach to this?

For each one, write down  
one key _positive_ indicator and  
one key _negative_ indicator.

For each indicator, write down _why_.

# Splitting a Monolith

(Hazel's Example Answer)

- What is the "cultural" approach to this?
  - Ways of working, teaching teams to work collaboratively, identifying potential services by team surveys, ...
- Positive indicator: Solving communication barriers
  - Why: Explicit communication balances losing the implicit context of a single codebase
- Negative indicator: Introducing process without context
  - Why: Teams will work around process if it hampers productivity

# Compensate for Bias

Before:

> "How would you approach splitting a monolith?"

After:

> **Let's work together** and examine the **process** of splitting a monolith.
>
> How would you approach this **culturally and technically**?  
> **Let's focus on the human elements first**.

# Validate Your Signals

- Do only men pass the technical interview?
- Does the "systems interview" weed out non-native english speakers?
- Do you primarily hand out offers to one demographic?
- Do regretted hires follow a predictable pattern?

<sup>(I have personally observed every single one of these)</sup>

# Iterate!
