  Have you ever wondered if there's something behind the experiential knowledge that we hold as best practices? I've noticed that things that "feel" right can often be connected together, and the connection between SLOs and observability feels right, like there's something deeper underneath.

  So, I've been digging into relationships between SLOs, observability, known knowns, unknown unknowns, cardinality, entropy, and more. There's still a lot of details to work out, but what I present here in this talk is a rough overview of where I'm at so far when it comes to motivating SLOs from a more interconnected perspective.
