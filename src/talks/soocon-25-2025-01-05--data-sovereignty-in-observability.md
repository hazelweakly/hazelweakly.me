abstract: |
  As OpenTelemetry rapidly becomes the standard for open-source observability instrumentation, the question of data sovereignty takes center stage. In this panel, Josh Lee moderates a lively discussion with Hazel Weakly, Robert Hodges, and Edith Puclla - leaders in the fields of observability, databases, and open source. Together, they will explore the implications of data sovereignty in observability, balancing control and compliance with innovation. Topics will include the role of open source tools, the challenges of ensuring data portability, and the future of observability architectures in a sovereignty-conscious world.
