title: "Feature Flag All the Things"
event: KubeCrash Fall 2024
location: Online
date: 2024-10-09
abstract: |
  Feature flags are amazing for derisking code and separating deployments from releases!
  However, ironically, for all of the enablement platform engineers do to build continuous delivery, our own infrastructure rarely gets to benefit.
  But! What if you could put Feature Flags into ArgoCD? What would that look like? How would it work?

  Join Hazel in a fast paced talk as she goes over how feature flags might work for infrastructure and how one can integrate them into ArgoCD.
  We'll demonstrate this with a proof of concept of tying together a feature flag for the frontend, backend, and infrastructure in a seamless way.

  (Note: This talk had to be rewritten right before presenting it due to the demo completely breaking...)
