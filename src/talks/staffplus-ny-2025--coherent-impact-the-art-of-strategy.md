  A story of building long-term outcomes out of the chaos of daily reality.

  Have you ever tried to build a house on quicksand? I can’t imagine it would work very well! The ground is so chaotic and the landscape itself isn’t reliable enough to be the foundation you need. It feels like you can’t even get started, let alone build something sturdy enough to last.

  Honestly, trying to build an engineering strategy and an engineering organization in today’s environment feels just as chaotic. Things are churning faster and faster, and the days of clear strategy are long gone (if they ever existed in the first place). Quarterly planning? Long-term thinking? Some days they feel like relics of the past, so what’s a leader to do?

  In this session, join Hazel as she walks through a journey of how she took a rapidly evolving environment, where only short term goals could survive, and turned that chaos into something that long term success could be built on top of.

  ## Key takeaways

  - Strategies for making local decisions pay off in the long run.
  - Techniques to not get buried in the firefighting.
  - What worked, what didn’t, what would Hazel have done differently?
