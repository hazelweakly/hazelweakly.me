title: "Carrying The Torch: Grief and Remembrance in Open Source"
event: "LinuxFest Northwest"
location: Bellingham, WA
date: 2025-04-27
abstract: |
  When we contribute to open source, we build projects that can withstand the tests of time. But, even more than that, when we contribute to open source, we become part of a community larger than us.

  So, when people leave, when they're taken, when they're lost, what do we do? How do our projects, and theirs, survive? More importantly, what does it mean to honor the memories and the people, the legacies, that have brought us to where we are today?

  How, on Earth, do we carry that torch? In this session, Hazel is going to reflect on her experiences of loss and grief. Together, she'll walk us through a journey of what she's learned about carrying the torch and remembering what was as we build the future together.
