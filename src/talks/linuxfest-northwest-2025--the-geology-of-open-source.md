  Time changes all, even what we might consider the unchangeable. This is particularly evident when we look at geology; from the mountains to the oceans, from the caverns to the prairies, and even the very heavens themselves. Everything changes.

  So, why fight it? Why not embrace the change? The cycle of life? Why not learn to love this evolution inherent in the nature of our universe itself? Why do we resist this so deeply in software?

  Is it our human nature, or something else?

  What would happen if we learned to lean in and appreciate the movements of the universe? What would happen if we stopped fighting time and entropy? What would that mean for us and our industry?

  Let's explore an idea together with Hazel Weakly: What if we built our software, our communities, and our ecosystems with the intentions of letting them go? What if we thought of our projects as ideas? What if we cared more about the learning and the journey than the name of the software or where it lived in a codebase?

  What if we treated the end of projects as a celebration of beautiful new beginnings?
