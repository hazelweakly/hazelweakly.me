  OpenTelemetry is everywhere, used by engineers in all roles.
  For telemetry data to provide effective observability it must permeate all areas of a software system, all the way up the domain-specific aspects that matter the most to end users.
  As a cross-cutting concern, it should be used within business logic to describe application internals.
  However, engineers in charge of developing new features are not always empowered with the modern observability practices supported by OpenTelemetry and, in a distributed environment, this may damage the overall observability of the system.
  In this panel, leaders from organizations at the forefront of this field take us through their experiences building platforms, tooling, enablement materials, and team topologies that allow them to scale adoption of OpenTelemetry best practices with minimal friction, and ensure that the telemetry data produced by their systems is of the highest quality, provides value, and maximizes return-on-investment.
