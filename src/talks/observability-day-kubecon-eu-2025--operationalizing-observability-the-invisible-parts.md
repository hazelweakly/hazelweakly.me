  Observability is increasingly becoming a differentiator in developer experience and in sustaining system health. Despite this, vendor bills are higher than ever, infrastructure budgets are lower, and the ROI is increasingly harder to sell.

  Join Hazel in this talk as she takes you through:
  - What it takes to get buy-in, what what that looks like, and when to not
  - What happens after procurement: Going from zero to day one
  - Achieving ROI beyond the engineering function

  This talk will be be packed full with actionable insights for employees wanting to implement observability, vendors wanting to sell, and OSS projects working to make the system better.
