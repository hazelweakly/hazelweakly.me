event: Monitorama PDX
location: Portland, OR

  Elephants may have a perfect memory, but humans sure don't; we're lucky to even see what we're looking at much less figure out what else is going on.
  Speaking of which, what ARE we even looking at over here at Hachyderm? We've had our share of major incidents and ongoing work; how has monitoring helped with that, and how has it not? These questions and more are going to be what we go over! Tune in to find out more about the monitoring stack we've built, why we chose it, and what we're doing next.
  While we're at it, we're going to be taking a deeper look at what monitoring is even for, how to know what you need, and the philosophical implications of it all.
