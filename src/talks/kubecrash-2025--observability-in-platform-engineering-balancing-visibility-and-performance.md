title: "Observability in Platform Engineering: Balancing Visibility and Performance"
event: "KubeCrash"
location: Virtual
date: 2025-05-08
abstract: |
  As platform engineering evolves to support scalable, self-service infrastructure, observability remains a critical yet complex challenge.
  How do teams ensure deep visibility without overwhelming developers with noise? How can organizations balance real-time insights with cost efficiency? This panel brings together observability and platform engineering experts to explore best practices for instrumenting platforms, correlating telemetry data, and driving actionable insights.
  Panelists will discuss real-world strategies for improving resilience, leveraging AI-driven observability, and aligning observability with business outcomes.
  Attendees will gain insights into how leading teams manage observability at scale, integrate open standards like OpenTelemetry, and foster a culture of proactive monitoring.
  Whether you're building internal developer platforms (IDPs) or optimizing existing infrastructure, this session will provide actionable takeaways for making observability a first-class citizen in platform engineering.
