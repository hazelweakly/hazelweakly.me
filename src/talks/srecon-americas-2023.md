  Cast your mind back to November 2022: Twitter's on fire, and Hachyderm has grown from its small 700 users to a roaring 30,000 users in one month. Now, not only is Twitter on fire, but our servers are too.

  In this talk, we're going to go over how we handled this, the decisions we made, the limitations we faced, and the friendships we found in each other.

  We migrated a distributed system across the Atlantic ocean while dealing with multiple types of failures and limitations in operational capabilities. Yet, we suffered zero data loss and we kept the trust of our beloved community by not letting them down.

  Not only that, but nobody burned out! We came out stronger and more prepared than ever. Come along with us on this journey. Together we'll relive the race against Time and the battle against the very fabric of Systemic Chaos itself.
