title: "So You Want to Hire for Platform Engineering?"
event: "Platform Engineering Day, KubeCon EU"
location: London, UK
date: 2025-04-01
abstract: |
  I see you want to hire a developer to work on platform engineering, internal developer tooling, developer experience, and the overall generally intangible but admirable goal of "making life better for devs". That’s awesome; you've got one hell of a challenge ahead of you. This role is extremely difficult to hire for. In my opinion, and in my experience, it’s been the most difficult role in the company outside of senior leadership, and the most likely to fail; if there ever was a role that burns people out, it’s this one.

  Come with Hazel as we draw on her experiences building platform teams and organizations in order to talk about making this platform engineering thing a reality. In doing so, we'll end up discussing topics such as

  - The hiring pipeline and interview loop
  - Timing, politics, and the meta strategies
  - Getting to zero from negative
  - Avoiding pitfalls
