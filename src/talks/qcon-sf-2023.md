  If you give a dev a platform, they're gonna want to... build things with it! Devs love a good platform, but what makes a platform good? Why are some platforms so good at enabling high-impact work while others make it harder to do high-impact work?

  In this talk, I'm going to be taking you through an approach that I've used, alongside some research, and show you how to build a playbook for creating high-impact platforms, inspired by my experiences in dramatically accelerating entire developer teams and organizations through the power of a platform that devs love.
