  Why is it that we're so good at building things that work, as long as nobody asks what "it works" means?
  Why is it that we're so good at shipping changes to production, as long as nobody asks what counts as "a change"?
  Together we'll go on a journey, touring the space of where humans meet configuration as code with a blend of stories, visions, laments, and insights.
