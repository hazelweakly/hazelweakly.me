title: "Not Just Another DEI Panel"
event: KubeHuddle
location: Toronto, CA
date: 2024-05-07
abstract: |
  According to tech journalist Jennifer Riggins, "While women make up between about 22 and 24% of the tech ​industry, they were 69% of layoffs."

  Clearly, DEI is still very much a problem in tech that needs to be addressed, and yet, talking about DEI seems ​to have fallen out of favour.

  This DEI panel aims to answer:
  * Whatever happened to DEI?
  * What are the things that make us cringe about DEI panels?

  It also highlights some incredible ladies in tech and their incredible journeys.
