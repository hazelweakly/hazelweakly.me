title: "Redefining Observability: Observability 3.0"
event: "SCaLE 22x"
location: Pasadena, CA

  You've heard of observability, you've heard of the the three pillars, and you've probably even heard of observability 1.0 vs 2.0. But, something's still missing. Our definitions of observability are so technical that they miss the real value: a process through which one develops the ability to ask meaningful questions, get useful answers, and act effectively on what you learn.

  In an era of tight budgets and doing too much with too little, executing an observability strategy that delivers meaningful impact can feel impossible. In this talk, we'll learn how to cross the chasm from theory into delivering value where it matters. As we do so, we're going to start bringing together every part of the company by understanding how building home baked abstractions unlocks interdisciplinary collaboration.

  The talk will be packed with concrete examples of meshing institutional context with operational excellence. We'll also go over actionable steps that can be taken regardless of where you are on your observability journey, regardless of what your budget is, and how to get started when you don't have time.

  Join Hazel as she blends together a vision of the future with the realities of today in a way that prepares you to seize the moment and level up your company's ability to effectively operate across functional and disciplinary lines.
