abstract: |
  An interview with Hazel Weakly, a software developer, platform engineer, and advocate for building more humane technological ecosystems.

  We start by discussing Hazel’s motivations behind a recent blog post calling for a more human-centered approach to technology.
  The conversation explores themes like the role of AI, the impact of algorithmic bias, and the commodification of online interaction, which Hazel views as eroding genuine human connection.

  This transitions into a discussion about how to create alternatives, including social networks and developer tools, such as programming languages.
  Hazel contrasts the philosophies behind Rust and Haskell, emphasizing Rust’s balance between safety, usability, and developer experience.
  She articulates her broader vision for technology—creating tools that enable collective actualization, where individuals and communities are empowered to achieve more than they imagined possible.
