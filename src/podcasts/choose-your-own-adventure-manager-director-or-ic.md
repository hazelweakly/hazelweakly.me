title: "Choose Your Own Adventure: Manager, Director, or IC"
event: Day Two DevOps
date: 2024-04-24
abstract: |
  What makes for a good manager, director, and independent contributor (IC), and how do you figure out which is the best fit for you? Hazel Weakly has had a whirlwind tour of all three and is ready to share her insight into each. We talk about the skill set needed for each, and figuring out what you’re good at versus what you’re world class at. We dive into her experience of effectively growing headcount (spoiler: no, return to office isn’t necessary). Plus we cover how to learn soft skills like empathy, the ability to ground yourself in stressful situations, and building adaptive capacity into your schedule.
