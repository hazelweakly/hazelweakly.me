title: "Software Development As Collective Learning With Hazel Weakly"
event: The Beautiful Mess
date: 2024-04-28
abstract: |
  > Back in late February, Tom Kerwin and I wrote a post titled How Capable Leaders Navigate Uncertainty and Ambiguity. The post listed 18 competencies—things like Accept We are Part of the Problem and Blend Diverse Perspectives—along with sample questions you could ask yourself or someone else to reflect on each competency.
  >  
  > A couple of days later, Hazel Weakly shared a deeply introspective post in which she used our post as the basis for a personal retrospective. I, like many others on LinkedIn, was completely blown away by the depth and thoughtfulness of the post.
  >  
  > In this episode, we talk about Hazel’s journey from individual force multiplier to focusing on collaborative learning and scaling that up. We talk about emergence and systems, developer productivity, architecture as a catalyst for coherent autonomy, migrations, being Done, Done Done, Done Done Done, and how being explicit about values, culture, and collaboration enables more graceful and continuous change. We end by discussing how leaders can’t wait for outcomes to introspect and get feedback (hence Hazel doing that deep dive personal retrospective).
