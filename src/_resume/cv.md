| Staff SRE | Eden Health | Sept. 2021--Aug. 2022

Eden Health provides concierge healthcare services for employees as an employment benefit.

As the first Security-focused Systems Reliability Engineer, I assisted in prioritizing security related initiatives that balanced current business needs while keeping future opportunities open.
I also coordinated and spearheaded projects focused on improving the developer experience, design systems, and architecture.

- Revamped developer on-boarding documentation and integrated a discoverable bootstrapping mechanism into projects, reducing on-boarding time by over 80% and enabling future automation opportunities.
- Designed the approach to developer environments, cultivating buy-in across the engineering and product organizations, and shepherding adaption of the chosen solution.
- Initiated and supervised vendor procurements to enable higher security, cost savings, and developer efficiency.
- Assisted with adaption of `open-telemetry` in the front-end by demonstrating benefits, improving knowledge sharing, and delivering an internal talk on the results.

- Developed an environment specification DSL in Nix in order to centralize and codify domain knowledge, automate basic local configuration checking, and allow for rapid iteration across all codebases while eliminating re-work and toil caused by environment drift and tooling mismatches.
- Created a cross-platform codebase for a design system that worked across React and React Native, allowing for seamless collaboration between design, product, and engineering teams.

- Built out the infrastructure required to adopt a mesh VPN solution as part of implementing Zero Trust Networking.
- Implemented and deployed self-hosted package registries, enabling SBOM auditing, reducing CI failures, and doubling CI install speeds.

| Build/Release Engineer | Galois, Inc\. | Dec. 2019--Sept. 2021

Galois, Inc., is a formal verification consulting company that specializes in high assurance software and cryptography.

As the first Ops employee, I assisted in shaping the career ladder and scope of responsibilities for DevOps, taking care to match existing concerns with evolving needs.
Part of that work resulted in advising on a coherent plan to address the recent growing desire inside the Department of Defence for transitionable R&D initiatives.

- Built out an internal platform, enabling infrastructure and tooling knowledge sharing and reuse.
- Architected and implemented an internal platform on top of Kubernetes, using GitOps and NixOS for a fully auditable, reproducible, and maintainable system.
- Reduced CI/CD pipeline times from days to minutes, and reduced complexity by consolidating from 4+ CI systems to 1 CI system.
- Shortened FPGA development loop by days, and enabled automated testing of FPGA machines by designing and deploying a CI system, testsuite, and cross-project CI coordination.
- Created development environments, CI/CD pipelines, and optimized releases for projects across a wide range of environments, from secure enclaves, to FPGAs, to cloud deployments.
- Enabled the shipping of modern development tooling into a highly isolated system by creating a fully self-bootstrapping environment suitable for non-privileged HPC-like systems.

As part of a small startup, I took part in shaping and leading initiatives related to improving every aspect of client and internal focused efforts and communication.

- Built and maintained a comprehensive design system, saving weeks of developer time.
- Fully restructured the codebase into a true monorepo, reducing build times by over 50%, and eliminating phantom code transpilation errors.
- Built a backend capable of self-healing ingestion of data from a slow internal API, increasing site responsiveness by over 90%.
- Implemented CI and reproducible developer environments, including for mobile development.
- Optimized server caching and improved peak traffic load capabilities by over 20x.
- Reduced average page load over 50%.
