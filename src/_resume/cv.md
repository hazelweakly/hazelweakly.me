# Experience

::: {.cv Title="Principal Architect - Platform" Company="[Datavant](https://datavant.com)" Date="Jan. 2024--Present"}

Developed, oversaw, and drove the technical vision for Platform Engineering and Infrastructure at Datavant.
Executed on broad impact projects with high visibility, leveled up the technical excellence of the organization, accelerated timelines exponentially, and derisked key initiatives.

- Architected the "Golden Path" of the company, building alignment around a strategy for reducing technical fatigue and accelerating development efforts.
- Designed and executed the observability strategy, including incremental adoption, improvement, platform capabilities and end-user integrations.
- Implemented a live migration of all existing services across multiple environments and clusters, with zero downtime or developer workflow disruption.
- Built a FedRAMP Moderate compliant Continuous Delivery platform, trained the team on usage and operation, accelerating the migration timeline by a quarter in order to deliver on time
- Executed exploratory work in order to align teams in the Platform Org on synergetic initiatives, converting proofs-of-concept into production-ready solutions.
- Built a multi-stage container testing framework, enabling platform teams to iterate fearlessly on improvements for product teams without regressions.

Hired a long-term Head of Platform, grew team stability and fostered a healthy culture throughout rapid org evolution, while improving team-level efficiency.

- Reduced interrupt driven work by over 70%, bringing WIP load to sustainable levels, accelerating project timelines by several months.
- Facilitated and designed interview loops to rapidly hire the most diverse teams in the CTO org within a single quarter, achieving high quality hires more than twice as fast as the org average.
- Developed data-driven Developer Experience initiatives, turning them into a smooth on-ramp for the new Developer Experience team's integration with the CTO org.
- Cultivated the culture of the Platform Org, resulting in ranking as a significant outlier in happiness, NPS, leadership trust, and core engagement metrics.

Led the Platform Org in an explicitly interim capacity, focusing on preparing the Org to go through an operational maturity transformation and be taken over by a long-term leader successfully.

- Built awareness around resource allocation needs for the Platform Org, leading to substantially re-allocating resources in order to right-size our infrastructure investment.
- Built a data-driven and strategic process around identifying and allocating developer experience interventions, leading to substantial improvements to developer satisfaction and velocity.
- Worked with Product Engineering, Security, and the CTO Leadership Team to build a narrative of cross-functional collaboration and trust, bringing about a significant improvement in the organization's alignment and messaging around Security and Platform.

Took a leading role in prioritizing security related initiatives.
Strong focus on improving the developer experience, design systems, and architecture.

- Created a cross-platform design system that worked across React and React Native, allowing for seamless collaboration between design, product, and engineering teams.
- Revamped developer on-boarding documentation and integrated a discoverable bootstrapping mechanism into projects, reduced on-boarding time by over 80% and created future automation opportunities.
- Designed the approach to developer environments; implemented change management across the engineering and product teams, eliminating entire categories of developer errors and friction points.
- Led adaption of `open-telemetry` by demonstrating benefits, implementing integrations, improving knowledge sharing, and delivering an internal talk on the results.
- Architected a Backend-for-Frontend architecture to facilitate rapid evolution and backwards compatibility across platforms such as iOS, Android, and the Web.

- Architected and implemented an internal platform on top of Kubernetes, using GitOps and NixOS for a fully auditable, reproducible, and maintainable system.
- Reduced CI/CD pipeline times from days to minutes, and reduced complexity by consolidating from 4+ CI systems to 1 CI system.
- Shortened FPGA development loop by days, and enabled automated testing of FPGA machines by designing and deploying a CI system, testsuite, and cross-project CI coordination.
- Created development environments, CI/CD pipelines, and optimized releases for projects across a wide range of environments, from secure enclaves, to FPGAs, to cloud deployments.
- Enabled the shipping of modern development tooling into a highly isolated system by creating a fully self-bootstrapping environment suitable for non-privileged HPC-like systems.
