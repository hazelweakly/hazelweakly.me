::: {.cv Title="Staff SRE" Company="[Eden Health](https://edenhealth.com)" Date="Sept. 2021--Aug. 2022"}

Took a leading role in prioritizing security related initiatives.
Strong focus on improving the developer experience, design systems, and architecture.

- Developed an environment specification DSL in Nix in order to allow for rapid iteration and increased efficiency.
- Created a cross-platform codebase for a design system that worked across React and React Native, allowing for seamless collaboration between design, product, and engineering teams.
- Built out the infrastructure required to adopt a mesh VPN solution as part of implementing Zero Trust Networking.
- Implemented and deployed self-hosted package registries, enabling SBOM auditing, reducing CI failures, and doubling CI install speeds.
- Revamped developer on-boarding documentation and integrated a discoverable bootstrapping mechanism into projects, reduced on-boarding time by over 80% created future automation opportunities.
- Designed the approach to developer environments, and implemented change management across the engineering and product teams.
- Initiated and supervised vendor procurements to enable higher security, cost savings, and developer efficiency.
- Lead adaption of `open-telemetry` in the front-end by demonstrating benefits, improving knowledge sharing, and delivering an internal talk on the results.

- Architected and implemented an internal platform on top of Kubernetes, using GitOps and NixOS for a fully auditable, reproducible, and maintainable system.
- Reduced CI/CD pipeline times from days to minutes, and reduced complexity by consolidating from 4+ CI systems to 1 CI system.
- Shortened FPGA development loop by days, and enabled automated testing of FPGA machines by designing and deploying a CI system, testsuite, and cross-project CI coordination.
- Created development environments, CI/CD pipelines, and optimized releases for projects across a wide range of environments, from secure enclaves, to FPGAs, to cloud deployments.
- Enabled the shipping of modern development tooling into a highly isolated system by creating a fully self-bootstrapping environment suitable for non-privileged HPC-like systems.
